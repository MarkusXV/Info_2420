          <p>The ABA is a non-profit organization that provides leadership to birders by increasing their knowledge, skills, and enjoyment of birding. They're the only organization in North America that specifically caters to recreational birders. They also contribute to bird and bird habitat conservation through our varied programs.</p>

        <h3>Great Backyard Bird Count</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Each February, for four days, the world comes together for the love of birds. Over these four days they invite people to spend time in their favorite places watching and counting as many birds as they can find and reporting them to us. These observations help scientists better understand global bird populations before one of their annual migrations.</p>
