      <!--Question 1-->
      <li>My first impressions are that it looks really professional but does come across as a little crowded at first. The element's are spaced quite closely and there's a lot of text right off the bat. I think that it's not too bad on the main header, side navigation, and footer sections though.</li>
      <!--Question 2-->
      <li>This site organizes it's information by having links on the left hand side as well as having the same links in the main body if your scroll down. The main text and body of the paages is on the right hand side.</li>
      <!--Question 3-->
      <li>I think it makes a lot of sense, but since there's not that many links you could put them as a horizontal sticky navigation bar at the top under the header so that you have more space for the main text.</li>
      <!--Question 4-->
      <li>The layout and graphics of the site enhance it by having one place to go in order to get to other pages on the site, and the main content of that page is always in the same place. The pictures enhance it by giving a nice appearance and also clues you to what the page is about. Having the layout links take up so much space though does detract from the main text's room in the middle.</li>
      <!--Question 5-->
      <li>The website loaded really quickly, like within two seconds and didn't take too long at all.</li>
      <!--Question 6-->
      <li>The text color was mainly black and was white if it was placed over an image. The size of the text was definitely readable and wasn't too small, without being overwhelmingly big.</li>
      <!--Question 7-->
      <li>The navigation tab was on the left for the main national park pages, as well as a secondary naviagtion bar at the top for more specific pages and locations. I think the navigation was done quite well and even groups the page links by their type.</li>
      <!--Question 8-->
      <li>The color scheme was mainly greyscale except for the pictures layed out as the main heading or the featured links section. </li>
      <!--Question 9-->
      <li>The design is decently responsive with smaller sizes where the menu turns into a hamburger at the top right. The pictures with links are appropriately spaced and layed on top of each other and it doesn't look too bad! Long paragraphs were even condensed with the Read more button listed so that you could expand it if you wanted to.</li>
      <!--Question 10-->
      <li>I think the site does a very good job of displaying what the national parks are designed to do, which is focus on nature and the environment. They didn't litter the page with pictures but there's just enough that it gives it a pop of color and makes the site really appealing.</li>
